ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Luca Postiglione, a software developer, researcher and a never-ending student.

ðŸ“« How to reach me:
- Personal e-mail:        <lucapostiglione10@gmail.com>

I'm currently a DevOps at OpenReply.
    
ðŸ”­ Worked on [krABMaga](https://github.com/krABMaga)(previously *Rust-AB*), a discrete events simulation engine for developing Agent-Based Model simulation exploiting the Rust language to provide efficiency, reliability, and ease of use. I'm still a member, improving engine perfomance and developing new features such as model-exploration using genetic algorithms and bayesian optimization based on metaprogramming.

ðŸ“– I have a master's degree in Computer Science, with a focus on Cloud, Distributed and Parallel Computing. I graduated at [UNISA](https://www.unisa.it), where actually I'm working as research fellow.
